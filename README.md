# Cheetah Monitoring Agent Documentation

This document provides a detailed explanation of the Cheetah Monitoring Agent, a lightweight tool written in Go. The agent collects system metrics and registers itself with the monitoring server. It also supports customizable configuration of ports to report in the registration message.

---

## Overview

The agent performs the following operations:

### 1. Agent Registration

- **Listener:** At startup, the agent opens a TCP listener on a random port and starts a dummy TCP server that continuously accepts incoming connections. This ensures that the chosen port remains open and reachable.
- **Port Reporting:** The agent sends its registration data to the server at the `/api/agent/register` endpoint. The registration payload includes:
  - **Hostname**
  - **IP Address**
  - **Open Ports:**  
    If the environment variable `PORTS` is set, the agent uses exactly that list (which can include individual ports and ranges, e.g., `8080,22,27017` or `9000-9090`). If `PORTS` is not set, the agent scans all ports from 1 to 65535 and returns only those that are open.
  - **Timestamp**
  - **AgentPort:** The port on which the dummy TCP server is listening.
- **Status:** The status of the agent ("UP" or "DOWN") is managed by the server based on reachability checks.

### 2. Metrics Sending

- The agent collects system metrics (hostname, IP, timestamp, CPU usage, disk usage, and RAM usage) using the `gopsutil` library.
- These metrics are sent periodically to the monitoring server at the `/api/metrics` endpoint.
- The sending interval is configurable via the environment variable `SEND_INTERVAL`.

## Environment Variables

The agent behavior can be customized using the following environment variables:

- **PORTS:**  
  A comma-separated list of ports or port ranges to include in the registration message.  
  Examples:
  - `8080,22,27017`
  - `9000-9090,1433`

  If `PORTS` is set, the agent will send exactly those ports without verifying if they are open.  
  If not set, the agent will perform a full port scan (1-65535) and include only the ports that are open.

- **MONITORING_SERVER_HOST:**  
  The hostname or IP address of the monitoring server.  
  *Default:* `localhost`

- **MONITORING_SERVER_PORT:**  
  The port on which the monitoring server is running.  
  *Default:* `8080`

- **SEND_INTERVAL:**  
  The interval (in seconds) between sending metrics to the server.  
  *Default:* `60` seconds

## How It Works

### 1. Registration Phase

- **Listener Setup:**  
  The agent opens a TCP listener on a random port (using `:0`) and starts a dummy TCP server in a goroutine that accepts and immediately closes incoming connections. This ensures that the agent remains reachable on the chosen port (`agentPort`).

- **Data Collection for Registration:**  
  The agent gathers:
  - Hostname (via `os.Hostname()`)
  - Local IP address (via `net.InterfaceAddrs()`)
  - Open Ports:  
    - If `PORTS` is defined, it parses the provided string (supporting comma-separated lists and ranges) and returns that list.
    - Otherwise, it scans ports 1 to 65535 (using concurrent goroutines with a concurrency limit) and returns only the ports that are open.
  - Timestamp (current Unix time in milliseconds)
  - AgentPort (the port where the dummy server is listening)

- **Sending Registration:**  
  The collected data is marshaled into JSON and sent via an HTTP POST to the endpoint:  
  `http://<MONITORING_SERVER_HOST>:<MONITORING_SERVER_PORT>/api/agent/register`

### 2. Metrics Collection and Sending

- **Metrics Collection:**  
  The agent collects system metrics using the `gopsutil` library:
  - CPU usage (percentage, averaged over one second)
  - Memory usage (used percentage)
  - Disk usage (for the root mount point)

- **Sending Metrics:**  
  The collected metrics, along with hostname, IP, and timestamp, are sent periodically (based on `SEND_INTERVAL`) via an HTTP POST to:  
  `http://<MONITORING_SERVER_HOST>:<MONITORING_SERVER_PORT>/api/metrics`

## Running the Agent

1. **Clone the Repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/edoardopelli/cheetah-monitoring-agent.git
cd cheetah-monitoring-agent
```

2. **Set Environment Variables:**

For example, in a Unix-like terminal:

```bash
export PORTS="8080,22,27017"
export MONITORING_SERVER_HOST="your.server.address"
export MONITORING_SERVER_PORT="8080"
export SEND_INTERVAL="60"
```

3. **Build and Run the Agent:**

Build the agent:

```bash
go build -o cheetah-monitoring-agent
```

Then run it:

```bash
./cheetah-monitoring-agent
```

The agent will start its dummy TCP server, register itself with the monitoring server, and begin sending system metrics periodically.

---

## Summary

- **Agent Registration:**  
  The agent registers itself with the monitoring server, sending hostname, IP, open ports (as defined by the PORTS variable or determined by scanning), timestamp, and the active listening port.

- **Metrics Sending:**  
  The agent periodically collects and sends system metrics to the monitoring server.

- **Configuration:**  
  The behavior is customizable via environment variables for ports, server address, and send interval.

- **Dummy Server:**  
  A dummy TCP server is kept active to ensure the agentâ€™s port is open and reachable for health checks.
